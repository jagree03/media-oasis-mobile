# Media Oasis Mobile App

The Media Oasis Mobile App is an Android application that is an extension of the fictional brand "Oasis" that sells video games, movies and TV Shows and any other visual media in physical format.

It is built upon my university project, [Café Oasis](https://github.com/jagree03/CTEC3911_MobileAppDev_Coursework) which is a Coffee Shop app also for the fictional "Oasis" brand that sells different types
of coffee, biscuits and drinks.

This application aims to be a general improvement over my previous project, Café Oasis.

**Tools**
- Android Studio + Android Virtual Device Emulation
- Google Images
- **Figma** to help design the user interface.
- SQLite Database
