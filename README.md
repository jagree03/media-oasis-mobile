# Media Oasis Mobile App

The Media Oasis Mobile App is an Android application that is an extension of the fictional brand "Oasis" that sells video games, movies and TV Shows and any other visual media in physical format.

It is built upon the design of my university project, [Café Oasis](https://github.com/jagree03/CTEC3911_MobileAppDev_Coursework) which is a Coffee Shop app also for the fictional "Oasis" brand that sells different types
of coffee, biscuits and drinks.

This application aims to be a general improvement over my previous project, Café Oasis. 

Such improvements include
- Improved UI/UX design with a gentle purple colour, white text and sleek 2000s Frutiger font
- Implementation of a slidable navigation view menu
- Fragments to reduce the number of activities of the application
- Notification system

**Tools**
- Android Studio + Android Virtual Device Emulation
- Google Images
- **Figma** to help design the user interface.
- SQLite Database
